The Pendulum Doesn’t Care Who It Hits on the Way Back We’re not living through a revolution. We’re living through recoil. The pendulum of culture doesn’t swing because people are evolving — it swings because people are exhausted. From 2016 to 2021, everything was social justice, identity, activism. Loud. Urgent. Morally inflexible. Some of it necessary. Some of it performance. A lot of it co-opted. Then came the burnout. The contradictions. The canceled careers. The corporate rainbow logos that meant nothing. By 2023, the same people who screamed for equity were muting their feeds and quietly deleting posts. Now we’re seeing a new wave rise — one coated in patriotism, “traditional values,” and national nostalgia. It feels clean. Familiar. Safe. Especially to those who feel like they lost their footing in a world that changed too fast, too loudly. But this isn’t a return to truth. It’s a reaction to chaos — real or imagined. We were told society was crumbling. Maybe it was. Maybe we were just tricked into thinking so. Either way, the effect is the same: fear. And fear craves order. So now we swing again. What was radical is now cringeworthy. What was cringeworthy is now righteous. And tomorrow? It'll all flip again. The pendulum doesn’t care what movement you believe in, or what ideals you fought for. It just builds momentum. And it hits everyone on the way back.
