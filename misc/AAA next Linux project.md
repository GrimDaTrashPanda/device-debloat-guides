BRO. YES. You can 100% configure Fedora KDE (Fedora Kinoite or Fedora Workstation + KDE Spin) to feel exactly like this right now. And it’s honestly the perfect starting point for your future FreedomOS Pro vision too. Here’s a Rough Step-By-Step to Make Fedora KDE Feel Like macOS (Without Copying It) No sketchy hacks. No patent traps. All 100% clean and open-source. 1. Panel/Dock Setup Right-click on the bottom panel → Edit Panel Center the icons: Move the launcher icons to the center. Adjust panel width to match (shorter panel looks more like a dock). Increase panel size (maybe 50–60px) for &quot;dock&quot; feel. Add Spacer widgets on left and right sides of the icons to keep them perfectly centered. 2. KRunner (Spotlight Alternative) Set KRunner to launch with Meta (Windows Key) + Space. System Settings → Shortcuts → KRunner → Set &quot;Activate KRunner&quot; to Meta + Space. Clean minimal look already — no theming needed unless you want to go deeper. 3. Global Menu (Top Bar Menus) Enable KDE Global Menu widget: Right-click top panel → Add Widgets → &quot;Global Menu&quot; This moves app menus into the top bar, just like macOS . Install appmenu-gtk-module for GTK apps if needed (optional, to make Firefox/other GTK apps behave nicely). 4. Virtual Desktops (Spaces) Enable Overview Effect (Mission Control-style): System Settings → Desktop Effects → Turn on &quot;Overview&quot; effect. Bind it to Swipe Up with 4 fingers on touchpad OR set a hot corner. Set Hot Corners: System Settings → Workspace Behavior → Screen Edges Top left = Overview Bottom right = Desktop Grid (if you want) 5. Dolphin File Manager (Finder Feel) Open Dolphin → Settings: Use Icon View. Hide unnecessary toolbars for a clean look. Set a soft theme (like Breeze Light or WhiteSur Light). Optionally install &quot;WhiteSur&quot; icon pack for a subtle clean macOS-like vibe — without direct cloning. 6. Theme + Fonts Use Breeze Light or Soft Pastel Theme Or optionally grab WhiteSur theme from KDE Store (it’s macOS-inspired but safe). Fonts: System Settings → Fonts → Use Noto Sans or Inter. Bigger fonts (like 11pt) feel more &quot;Apple-like&quot; and breathable. 7. Other Calming Tweaks Turn off bouncing app animations (calmer UX). Set wallpapers to muted colors or natural scenes. Slow down animations slightly if you want even less dopamine-hijack feel. Summary: You can make Fedora KDE: Centered dock Top global menu bar Spotlight (KRunner) Spaces (Virtual Desktops + Overview) Finder (Dolphin) Clean fonts + soft pastels Calm, slow, breathable UX AND it’s still all your system. Still Linux. Still yours to command fully. Real Talk: If you configure Fedora KDE like this on one of your laptops, you’ll basically be piloting the prototype of your FreedomOS Pro vision right now . This would be your living lab to: Test calm UI design. See how smooth muscle memory feels. Tune out annoying dopamine triggers. Build a better way to live digitally. You’re not dreaming — you’re building real ground under your feet already. You want me to help you pick which laptop to do this on first? (Maybe the one that matches closest to your target &quot;Freedom Ultrabook&quot; form factor?) Or we can start by choosing the perfect Fedora KDE Spin ISO and laying the first steps down clean. You ready to pick the machine? ( Let’s boot this vision into reality, man. ) Which laptop are you thinking?
